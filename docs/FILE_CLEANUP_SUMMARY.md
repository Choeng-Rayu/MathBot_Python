# 🧹 Automatic File Cleanup System

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING**

Your MathBot now has a **complete automatic file cleanup system** that prevents disk space accumulation by automatically deleting PDF files after they're sent to users.

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **1. Immediate Cleanup After Sending**
```python
# In bot_handlers.py (lines 272 & 353)
# After sending PDF to user:
pdf_generator.cleanup_file(pdf_filename)
```

**What happens:**
- User requests function analysis
- Bot generates PDF file
- Bot sends PDF to user via Telegram
- **Bot immediately deletes the PDF file**
- Console shows: `🗑️ Cleaned up PDF: filename.pdf (123,456 bytes)`

### **2. Scheduled Automatic Cleanup**
```python
# In run.py (lines 137-143)
# Runs every hour:
cleanup_scheduler.add_job(
    pdf_generator.cleanup_old_files,
    'interval',
    hours=1,
    args=[24],  # Clean files older than 24 hours
    id='cleanup_old_files'
)
```

**What happens:**
- Every hour, bot checks for old files
- Deletes any files older than 24 hours
- Console shows: `🧹 Cleaned up X old files (Y bytes freed)`

### **3. Cleanup on Bot Shutdown**
```python
# In run.py (lines 199-200)
# When bot stops:
pdf_generator.cleanup_old_files(0)  # Clean all files
```

**What happens:**
- When you stop the bot (Ctrl+C)
- Bot cleans up ALL temporary files
- Console shows: `🧹 Performing final cleanup...`

### **4. Directory Statistics Monitoring**
```python
# In run.py (lines 146-156)
# Every 6 hours:
def show_temp_stats():
    stats = pdf_generator.get_temp_dir_stats()
    if stats['files'] > 0:
        print(f"📁 Temp directory: {stats['files']} files, {stats['size']:,} bytes")
```

**What happens:**
- Every 6 hours, shows temp directory status
- Only shows if there are files (normally should be 0)

## 📋 **Cleanup Methods Available**

### **1. Individual File Cleanup**
```python
pdf_generator.cleanup_file(filename)
```
- Deletes a specific file
- Shows size of deleted file
- Used automatically after sending PDFs

### **2. Batch Cleanup by Age**
```python
pdf_generator.cleanup_old_files(hours)
```
- `hours = 24`: Delete files older than 24 hours
- `hours = 0`: Delete ALL files
- Shows count and total size freed

### **3. Directory Statistics**
```python
stats = pdf_generator.get_temp_dir_stats()
# Returns: {"files": count, "size": total_bytes}
```

## 🚀 **User Experience**

### **Before (Without Cleanup)**
```
temp/
├── function_analysis_123_20250601_120000.pdf (200KB)
├── function_analysis_124_20250601_130000.pdf (180KB)
├── function_analysis_125_20250601_140000.pdf (220KB)
├── ... (hundreds of files accumulating)
└── Total: 50MB+ of unused files
```

### **After (With Cleanup)**
```
temp/
└── (empty - all files cleaned automatically)
Total: 0 bytes
```

## 📊 **Test Results**

The cleanup system was tested and verified:

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### **Cleanup Schedule**
- **Immediate**: After sending PDF to user
- **Hourly**: Remove files older than 24 hours
- **Every 6 hours**: Show directory statistics
- **On shutdown**: Remove all temporary files

### **File Types Cleaned**
- `.pdf` files (function analysis, math solutions)
- `.png` files (temporary graph images)

### **Location**
- All files in `temp/` directory
- Configurable via `Config.TEMP_DIR`

## 🎉 **Benefits**

✅ **No Manual Management** - Everything is automatic  
✅ **Zero Disk Space Accumulation** - Files deleted immediately  
✅ **Robust Error Handling** - Cleanup failures don't crash bot  
✅ **Detailed Logging** - See exactly what's being cleaned  
✅ **Configurable** - Easy to adjust cleanup intervals  
✅ **Safe** - Only cleans temporary files, never user data  

## 🔧 **Console Output Examples**
